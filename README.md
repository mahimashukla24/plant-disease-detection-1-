# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It identifies diseases in **Apple**, **Pepper**, **Potato**, and **Tomato** crops. The model can help farmers take timely action to prevent crop loss.

## 🧠 Diseases Detected

The model classifies 14 categories:

### 🍏 Apple:
- Apple Scab
- Cedar Apple Rust
- Healthy

### 🌶️ Pepper (Bell):
- Bacterial Spot
- Healthy

### 🥔 Potato:
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Healthy

### 🍅 Tomato:
- Bacterial Spot
- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
- Tomato Mosaic Virus
- Healthy
